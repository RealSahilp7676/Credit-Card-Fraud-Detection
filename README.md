# Credit Card Fraud Detection using XGBoost

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning pipeline. Transaction data includes merchant details, amount, user demographics, and time-based features. The model is built using **XGBoost**, which is highly effective for handling imbalanced tabular datasets.

---

## Task Objectives

- Build a fraud detection system that **minimizes false positives** while **maximizing fraud detection accuracy**.
- Perform **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to identify patterns in fraudulent transactions.
- Preprocess the data using standard techniques and **OneHotEncoding** for categorical features.
- Train an **XGBoost Classifier** with engineered features.
- Evaluate the model using metrics like **confusion matrix**, **ROC-AUC**, and **classification report**.
- Analyze misclassifications and their implications.

## Steps to Run the Project in Google Colab

### 1. Open the Colab Notebook

- Download or copy the notebook credit_card_fraud_detection_xgboost_colab.ipynb to your Google Drive.
- Open it with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### 2. Install Dependencies

At the top of the Colab notebook, run the following cell to install required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

### 3. Upload the Dataset

- Download the dataset files and place them in the root directory:
  - `fraudTrain.csv`
  - `fraudTest.csv`
- In Colab, use the file upload widget to upload both files:
  ```bash
  from google.colab import files
  uploaded = files.upload()
  ```
  
### 4. Run the Notebook

Execute all cells in order to perform EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## üìä Output Highlights

- **EDA Visualizations**:
  - Fraud rate by transaction category
  - Transaction amount distribution for fraud vs. non-fraud
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
  - Confusion matrix (with heatmap)
  - ROC curve and AUC score

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Misclassification Insights

- **False Positives (FP)**: Legitimate transactions flagged as fraud ‚Äì user inconvenience.
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Fraudulent transactions missed ‚Äì potential financial loss.
- Focus is placed on minimizing FN while keeping FP under control.

---

## üìå Notes

- Features include age, transaction hour, and day of week, derived from datetime fields.
- Data is preprocessed using **StandardScaler** for numeric and **OneHotEncoder** for categorical features.
- The model is trained on `fraudTrain.csv` and tested on `fraudTest.csv`.
